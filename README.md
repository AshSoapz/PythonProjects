# PythonProjects

Hey guys, welcome to my PythonProjects, projects that actually serve real-world use. I plan to make a few YouTube Video Downloaders, Discord Bots, Automation Bots, Websites, etc. 

I invite you to join me on this amazing journey! 

About me:

Bloke from NW England, learning and using various programming languages and striving towards making one's workload (as in, menial work - high level) and suchlike easier so they can focus on more important and urgent things. I have a few mentors in this field, fantastic people and have been seeking and heeding their lessons and advice for a while. I also am using a range of resources to learn! From FreeCodeCamp to TechTim on YouTube! 

I play games with my friends most days, have worked in Customer Service, build computers, and love learning (no, like seriously); I find adding to one's store of knowledge is paramount in living in this world, hence, if you aren't learning, you aren't really living, even if it is one small thing, learn it! This world is a big and beautiful place, learning and connecting is totes important. I like the Sciences and Humanities (see, I wasn't kidding haha) and am quite good at them.
I also hold physical fitness and mental fitness to a high standard, in that, they should be of most importance; exercising, training in combat sports (MMA for me personally), and mental aid, is a neccessity. Prayer and Meditation naturally come into that. Anyways, this aint a bloody biography haha, enjoy the projects.
